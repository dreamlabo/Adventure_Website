# Adventure Website
Simple "brochure" website I put together after being inspired by a youtube video talking about flexbox.
I also focused on implementing better semantic HTML.
Overall, the site could have been built using simple HTML/CSS however, I wanted to continue to focus on my React web development, especially building reusable components.

## Technologies Used
* React
* HTML
* CSS
