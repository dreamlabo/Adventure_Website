# Adventure Website
Simple "brochure" website I put together after being inspired by a youtube video talking about flexbox.

Overall, the site could have been built using simple HTML/CSS, however, I wanted to continue to focus on my React web development, especially building reusable components.

I also focused on implementing better semantic HTML.
